The corpus has been downloaded from the Github repository "https://github.com/snkim/AutomaticKeyphraseExtraction".

The original corpus was divided only in "test" and "train" sets. We add the "validation" set by picking the first
5 documents from each category from the "train" set.

The original documents were removed in version 1.1 of the corpus due to licensing issues, but were still available
in a previous commit, accessible at this URL:

https://github.com/snkim/AutomaticKeyphraseExtraction/commit/963e46e2332d5cd502c5f720ab1842aacddc2118

Since the documents are freely available to anyone by accessing this URL, we include them in the present repository.
As the original authors stated in v1.1 of the corpus, " We are just providing this dataset for research and educational
purposes. If you believe it violates your copyright work please contact Luis [Marujo, or the owner of this repository]
to remove the document immediately."
